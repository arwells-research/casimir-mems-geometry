## ideal_scattering_minimal_v0

Minimal log-det / mode-mixing Level C backend for ideal reflectors.
This backend is synthetic and geometry-first; it is not a full EM Lifshitz solver.

See **Canonical Cases C12–C14** for the dual-harmonic phase-sensitivity benchmarks that establish Level C’s geometry-resolving capability beyond local and DE-based models.
