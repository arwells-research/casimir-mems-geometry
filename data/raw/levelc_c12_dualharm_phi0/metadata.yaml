scope:
  levelB:
    de_model: "ideal_conductor_em"
    intent: "diagnostic_bridge"
    disclaimer: >
      Level B uses ideal-conductor EM derivative expansion to quantify geometric
      beyond-PFA sensitivity. Banishev 2013 data are Au at 300 K; mismatches are
      expected and indicate finite conductivity/temperature effects reserved for
      Level C.
    notes: "Uses Bimonte beta_EM constant for ideal metals; not Au optical data."

  notes: >
    Minimal log-det / mode-mixing backend for ideal reflectors.
    Synthetic case used to demonstrate spectrum sensitivity beyond a pure sinusoid.
    This is still not a full EM scattering solver; it is a geometry-first, bounded
    nonlocal coupling construction.
