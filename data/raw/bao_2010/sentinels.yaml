# Sentinels for Bao et al., PRL 105 (2010)
# These validate the digitized ratio curve eta(d) = measured / PFA.
#
# Convention:
# - CSV stores eta_measured_over_pfa (dimensionless)
# - Enforcement is applied directly to the digitized ratio
#
# Absolute tolerances reflect typical plot digitization uncertainty
# for smooth ratio curves.
