      C3 is a synthetic harness case that increases the Level C sweep envelope
      and tightens the convergence tolerance to stress-test the convergence
      wrapper and audit contracts.
    notes: "Harness-only: no claim of physical scattering."

    NOT PHYSICAL. This benchmark exists only to validate Level C convergence
    machinery, CSV schema, and refusal masking. Do not interpret as scattering.
